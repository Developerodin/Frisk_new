                                      <li>Some of our subscriptions require a 1, 3, 6 or 12 month commitment. If you subscribe for a 1, 3, 6 or 12 month agreement, we agree to write and edit a certain number of news stories as set out in your subscription within the initial term. If you cancel prior to the end of that initial period, no further work will be undertaken, and if you are in breach of our agreement, we will take screen shots of your current published news stories as evidence that executed our responsibilities and request their removal. </li>

                                      <li>Refunds (in part or in full) are only considered if we are unable to fulfill our contractual obligation to publish your news story or stories, subject to the paragraphs below. This Refund Policy must be read in its entirety and you acknowledge and agree to all of it upon puchasing any of our services. </li>
                                      <li>First Month Deliverables Can Be Delayed due to client not engaging with us in a timely manner: The speed of writing, editing and ultimately publication depends on how quickly you answer our questionnaire, respond to our initial drafts with comments or your approval and how smoothly the writing process progresses as set out below. You can rewrite our news stories to speed up the process. You agree and acknowledge that if there is back and forth on the writing process which causes delay, or if there are public holidays that slow down the process in Month 1, that we will catch up in Month 2 and that you will not use this as a basis to request a refund, charge back and no such refund will be granted in this regard. </li>
                                      <li>Good Faith: If, after making a good faith effort to work with you to write an article or articles, you have not provided sign-off or failed to provide any edits or replied to our emails, then no refund will be issued. We will always publish your stories where indicated in your publication plan with your consent, and if a publication requires changes that you deem unacceptable, we will find another publication to publish your news story. </li>
                                      <li>Dissatisfaction with Writing Style: We take great pride in the expertise and skills of our team of writers, journalists, and editors, and we have the utmost confidence in the quality of the work we provide to our clients. However, we do not entertain requests for full or partial refunds in the event that you are dissatisfied with the content we submit or if you opt to compose your own news stories. We strongly encourage you to engage in a collaborative effort with us during the drafting process to ensure that our news stories effectively convey the message they intend to communicate to your audience. </li>
                                      <li>Undisclosed, Adverse Information About Clients: In the event that we engage with you in good faith, and you withhold information about your business or person which leads to a publication not publishing due to an active criminal or civil case which was not known to us at the time of engagement, we will make reasonable efforts to publish your story on alternate news sites that are more tolerant of companies and individuals before the courts. In such a case, you are not entitled to a refund, but we will use our best efforts to publish the number of news stories purchased on alternate news sites. We will not refund if you ask us to defame a person or company after making payment. </li>
                                      <li>News Stories Do Not Remain Live Forever: The Neuralnest guarantees publicity services to its clients, including the publication of news stories and the provision of reports upon publication. However, The Neuralnest does not offer refunds if the news story is published, goes live, and a report is sent to the client, and subsequently the news story is taken down after publication or the publication or website itself ceases to exist. This is because The Neuralnest has fulfilled its obligation to provide the agreed-upon publicity services, and any external factors beyond The Neuralnest’s control that affect the continued availability of the publication or website do not constitute a breach of contract by The Neuralnest.</li>
                                      <li>Failing To Cancel Prior To Next Billing Date: Monthly subscriptions are non-refundable and must be cancelled prior to your next billing date in order to avoid being charged. If a cancellation is not received before the next billing date, no refund will be issued. If the subscription is cancelled, no refunds will be issued for any partial membership periods or unused article credits but we will honour all the deliverables based on whatever option you purchase, pro-rate for the time in which you pay us. Refunds are not issued for the first month’s service, but pro-rate news stories purchased will be delivered as soon as you engage with us to approve our publication plan or draft stories, although if you cancel within the first 3 months, we will choose the publications from your publication plan that allow the fastest turn around time so we can conclude our relationship in the fastest possible time after cancellation. </li>
                                      <li>What Happens If We Don’t Publish On The .com Version? We publish news stories on news sites that are either .com, or a subsidiary site, depending on our inventory and our contacts for a particular publication. For example, Forbes is often published via Forbes Australia, or Forbes Israel. The same for Entrepreneur.com which is often published via contributors who live in different parts of the world. Each publication will have its own peculiarities and you can ask questions about the format of an article, or the domain or sub-domain of an article prior to publication, but cannot request a refund or a replacement article after it has been published. No refund will be issued, nor any article or news story republished because you are not happy with our publication plan to the extent that some publications are subsidiary sites of the .com brand, or that the article or news story was published on .com, or a subsidiary site, or that you are not happy with the country of origin of the Contributor that publishes your article. You acknowledge that you were shown examples of where we publish your news stories during the sales process, and to the extent that you claim you weren’t, the full list with examples is located here. </li>
                                      <li>Purchasing By Accident Or For Other Reasons Where Client No Longer Wants or Needs Service: Refunds will not be provided for accidental purchases, medical conditions or any reason at all which prevents you from engaging with us or publishing articles after payment, or any similar reason or event</li>
                                      <li>Wikipedia engagements are non-refundable if we publish news stories about you or your company, and your page is subsequently deleted. Wikipedia is crowd-sourced and has strict content and notability guidelines, as well as a dedicated community of editors and administrators who work diligently to maintain the site’s integrity and accuracy.
                                          We will use our best endeavours to cover your news in a way that is likely to pass editorial guidelines for Wikipedia, but it is outside our control if your page is subsequently amended or deleted. If this happens, we will substitute your Wikipedia page for a page on Wikitia, which has a lower bar for notability but you will not be eligible for a refund.</li>
                                      <li>No refund if you want us to write about topics we do not write about: There is a comprehensive list of topics we do not write or publish in these FAQs and Terms & Conditions. If you purchase one of our services and then instruct us to write about a prohibited topic, we will suggest other topics that are permitted, but no refunds will be issued. </li>
                                      <li>Failure to utilize allocated news stories within 1 year of engagement: No refund if you haven’t consumed your publication allocation within 12 months of engaging us if you are no longer under a retainer or if you purchased a one-off allotment of stories. Clients acknowledge and agree that no refunds will be provided for news stories not utilized within the specified one (1) year period. This condition is applicable regardless of whether a client terminates their retainer agreement or chooses not to utilize the remaining allocated news stories from their final or subsequent months within the one (1) year timeframe. This policy is in place to ensure the efficient allocation of our resources and to maintain the high-quality service we provide to our clients.
                                          It is the responsibility of the Client to ensure that they plan and utilize their allocated news stories within the timeframe specified. The Neuralnest will provide reminders and assistance in story planning to encourage the full use of services purchased. However, the ultimate responsibility to use the allocated news stories rests with the Client.</li>

Some publications change their policy on following back links, or later change a followed back link to a no-followed back link. We have little control over this element of our service, and there are no refunds in case a followed link becomes “no followed” after publication. We will give the most updated information to you during the sales process, but publications change their link policy from time to time.<br>

                                      Despite not contributing to link building for SEO purposes, nofollow links can still drive valuable referral traffic to a website if someone clicks on them. A well-placed blog comment with a nofollow link can generate a significant amount of traffic and eventually lead to conversions. In addition, nofollow links can also directly result in someone spending money on a company’s products or services if the company consistently creates awareness and engages with its audience.<br>

                                      Finally, links, whether nofollow or not, help build trust and establish a company as an industry authority. Therefore, it’s important to consider what links are good for a business and its brand, rather than solely focusing on what links are good for SEO purposes. Some experts recommend having an equal balance of follow and nofollow links, while others suggest having a greater number of follow links.
